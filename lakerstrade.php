                        <p>  The NBA trade deadline is now only two days away and according to sources, trade talks are beginning to heat up around the league

Though it seems doubtful that the Lakers make a substantial move at the deadline, or any trades at all for that matter, with more and more names being thrown into the pot every minute, a blockbuster trade somewhere in the league appears inevitable at this point.

Los Angeles’ stagnation revolves around many things, but is mostly due to the fact that they are unwilling to break up their young core, which is actually good news for the Lakers. That said, the pieces they are willing to part with — Roy Hibbert, Nick Young, Lou Williams, Brandon Bass — aren’t likely to bring in a large haul.

Regardless, it is interesting to see some of the names on the trading block, players that could seriously shift the momentum for a team, quickly turning them from pretender to contender.
Point Guard: Jeff Teague
Honorable Mention: Ricky Rubio

Sadly, since entering the league, Atlanta Hawks point guard, Jeff Teague, has been wildly underrated. Likely due to his mild mannered demeanor, Teague continues to fly under the radar almost every year.

Subtracting Russell Westbrook and Stephen Curry from the equation, who are statistical outliers, when comparing his per 36 minute stats to the rest of the point guards in the league, Teague is actually one of the best in the business.

    Report: Pacers Want to Trade George Hill for Jeff Teague https://t.co/iSAv065YoM pic.twitter.com/hSlDES91mU

    — Jared Wade (@8pts9secs) February 9, 2016

Averaging just around 19 points, 3 rebounds and 7 assists per 36, he’s shown his ability to run an NBA offense, leading the Hawks to a 31-24 record, good for fourth in the Eastern Conference. Seeing how the Hawks were willing to entertain the Indiana Pacers’ offer of George Hill for Teague, it’s apparent that Atlanta still doesn’t appreciate what a gem they happened to stumbled upon.

That said, plenty of teams could benefit by trading for the sixth year point guard. Imagine a team like the San Antonio Spurs trading for Teague to bolster their bench and prepare for life without Tony Parker. Scary thought.
