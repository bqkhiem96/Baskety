                        <p>   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) Oklahoma has honored former star Blake Griffin by retiring his jersey number in a ceremony at
                          halftime of the Sooners' game against Baylor.

Griffin was on hand for the event Tuesday. He was named the AP National Player of the Year in 2008-09 after
 averaging 22.7 points and 14.4 rebounds per game and leading the nation in rebounding and double-doubles. The Sooners finished 30-6 that season and reached the Elite Eight.

His jersey joins men's players Alvan Adams, Wayman Tisdale, Stacey King and Mookie Blaylock.

Griffin, who plays for the Los Angeles Clippers, has missed two months while recovering from a partially torn left quadriceps tendon. He broke his hand punching Clippers assistant equipment manager Matias Testi and will serve a four-game suspension for that incident when healthy. Griffin said he's ''very close'' to being ready to play.
