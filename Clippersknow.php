            <h1>Clippers know Griffin holds key to any long playoff run</h1>
            <p> SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The questions kept coming at Chris Paul as he sat in front of his locker after a game, the same way the wins keep coming, and he maneuvered around each with the same skill and certainty of CP3 picking apart a defense, until he had driven the topic in the direction he wanted.
              Blake Griffin is the direction Paul wanted. Any discussion about the Los Angeles Clippers, where they are as one of the hot teams of the league and where they are going with new hope as a Western Conference threat to the rival
              Golden State Warriors is about the power forward who is missing but very present.
