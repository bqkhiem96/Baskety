                                        <h1>When is Kobe's last game?</h1>
                                        <p> A look at when Lakers legend Kobe Bryant will play his final NBA game?
                                          It’s an oddly sad and nostalgic time to be a Los Angeles Lakers fan for a number of reasons. While it’s obviously not a great feeling to be a fan of one of the two worst teams in the league for the 2015-16 NBA season, this also happens to be the final season in the NBA and with the Lakers for one of the greatest players in the history of the franchise: Kobe Bryant.

                                          Not long into the season, Kobe Bryant announced that this, his 20th NBA season, would be his last in the league and with the Lakers as he would be retiring at the end of the season. What has followed since has been an ongoing slew of tributes from opposing teams when the Lakers have been on the road and even from the league as a whole at NBA All-Star Weekend.
                                          It’s not hard to imagine even for non-Lakers fans as to why Bryant’s retirement means so much to the organization and the league. By any measure, he’s one of the best players in the history of
                                          the entire franchise and one of the greatest players to ever take the floor in the NBA. Subsequently, many fans have to be wondering when Kobe Bryant will lace up his Nikes for the last time in a Lakers uniform.
                                          Assuming that Kobe stays healthy through the rest of the season, his final NBA game will take place at home at STAPLES Center against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday, April 13, 2016. The game will tip-off at 7:30 p.m. PST and is currently slated to air nationally on ESPN.  </div>
