                        <p> CHICAGO — A missed game here, a missed game there. At this rate, Derrick Rose is going to play only 70 games for the Chicago Bulls this season -- and someone should probably Tweet out #firstworldproblem to keep this all in perspective.
                          To date, Rose has appeared in 48 of Chicago's 56 games -- or 85 percent of them. Rose appearing in 70 games in any of his previous four NBA seasons would have been a cause for celebration. The Bulls and their fans would have been thrilled to have had their former All-Star and MVP point guard 85 percent of the time, playing with 85 percent of the effectiveness and sizzle he flaunted at the 2010-11 peak of his powers.

                          Thrilled? Tom Thibodeau might still be coaching them if he'd had Rose in the lineup 85 percent of the time in their five seasons together rather than the 46 percent he got. Chicago's winning percentage when Thibodeau and Rose paired up was .729, better than Phil Jackson's .704 career mark. But Thibodeau coached 213 times without Rose vs. 181 with him.

                          I love the way I'm playing. I feel like I'm playing to win. I feel like I'm in a good mood, a great place mentally. Just trying not to risk all of it by going out there and playing crazy.

                          – Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose

                          All of which is to say, if this is how it's going to go for Rose and the Bulls from now on -- the abrupt, occasional absence once every seven games or so, on average -- it's a minor inconvenience relative to what their reality had been over the past three or four years.

                          No one liked it when Rose essentially scratched himself from the lineup slightly more than an hour before Wednesday's game against the Washington Wizards. Not Bulls teammates, who already had to face Eastern Conference foes while fighting for playoff-worthy survival without Jimmy Butler (left knee strain), Nikola Mirotic (appendicitis) and Joakim Noah (shoulder surgery).

                          Not the fans at United Center, who'd already bought their tickets and had been buoyed by Rose's recent performances (26.0 ppg, 4.7 apg, 57.4 percent shooting in three games since the All-Star break, a 21.9 scoring average in February). Not ESPN, which had locked into the game as a national telecast, hoping to play up the Rose vs. John Wall matchup of past and current All-Star guards. Certainly not Wall, who craves a greater profile but wound up with the wrong kind of
                          attention after he and the Wizards lost the game, 109-104, to a depleted Bulls squad. </p>
