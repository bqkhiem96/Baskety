                          ATLANTA (AP) â€” The Atlanta Hawks signed veteran forward Kris Humphries on Tuesday night, adding experienced depth to their front line.

 Humphries was waived by Phoenix on Sunday after averaging 7.3 points in four games. He was 0 for 9 from the field in his last game against the Nets on Thursday.

 He began the season with Washington, where he averaged 6.4 points in 28 games, including 14 starts.

 "As we explored opportunities to add to our team after the trade deadline, we felt it was important to prioritize experience and versatility," Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said. "Kris is a versatile veteran with playoff experience who fits well with our group and within our system. We are fortunate to have Kris join our team and would like to welcome him to the Hawks family."

 Atlanta announced the move before its game at Golden State.

 The 6-foot-9 Humphries has career averages of 6.9 points and 5.4 rebounds with Utah, Toronto, Dallas, Brooklyn, Boston, Washington and Phoenix. He was a first-round pick by Utah in 2004.

 The Hawks' front-line depth took a hit when center Tiago Splitter, acquired last summer from San Antonio, was sidelined by a lingering hip injury. The team announced last month that Splitter needed season-ending surgery.

 Humphries will join Mike Scott and Mike Muscala as front-line options off the bench.

 The Hawks also assigned guard Lamar Patterson to Canton of the NBA Development League.
